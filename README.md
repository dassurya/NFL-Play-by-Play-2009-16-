Project Title: Data cleaning and processing
The objective of this project was to understand the data and create a model that helps in the predictive analysis of the data set.
The preliminary tasks include Cleaning, Identifying null values, Sorting, Outliers, Correcting errors, Removing Duplicates, Feature engineering
The data visualization part includes a Pairplot for understanding relations with each column followed by a Correlation matrix for finding multicollinearity and a heatmap for visualization to understand it.
It started with a baseline model -Logistic Regression and then went on with multiple models to reduce the Adjusted R-squared value using EPA as a dependent variable.
